<h3>schindler's list</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/schindlers_list_pic.jpg" width="400" height="300"/>
<p>an epic historical drama film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg. This movie reminds me of how quickly humanity can be turned against itself if led by the wrong man. I like to watch the horrific occurrences and the pain and suffering people endured during world war II because it makes me vigilant.</p>
<h3>Mad Max: fury road</h3>

<p>Directed by George Miller, this post-apocalyptic masterpiece is filled with breathtaking action scenes. you can watch this movie without understanding the story but still enjoy the crazy dystopian world depicted in the movie.</p>
<h3>The wolf of wall street</h3>

<p>Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption, and the federal government. arguably one of my favorite of all time.</p>
